				Download instructions:

1) install Java 11:  <a href="https://builds.openlogic.com/downloadJDK/openlogic-openjdk-jre/11.0.21+9/openlogic-openjdk-jre-11.0.21+9-windows-x64.msi">https://builds.openlogic.com/downloadJDK/openlogic-openjdk-jre/11.0.21+9/openlogic-openjdk-jre-11.0.21+9-windows-x64.msi</a>

2) Download the Launcher/installer/patcher: 

3) Move the launcher into folder you want the game to be installed in. We recommend making a dedicated folder.

4) Register yourself, at the moment email only needs to look like email, for example abcdef@gmail.com. Currently only lowercase characters work for logging into the game.

5) If you got problems, cry and let us know in Discord:  <a href="https://discord.gg/F8PKvRkmTZ">https://discord.gg/F8PKvRkmTZ</a> 


NOTE: We are unsure how many people our test server can handle. 
	If something seems broken, it most likely is, please report this in the discord server.
